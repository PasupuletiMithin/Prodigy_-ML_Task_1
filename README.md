House Price Prediction Project
This project demonstrates a basic example of using machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset is generated and saved as a CSV file, and a linear regression model is used to predict house prices. The project includes data loading, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.

Files:
  your_dataset.csv: The dataset containing house prices and features.
house_price_prediction.py: The Python script for data loading, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.

Requirements:
The project requires the following Python libraries:
pandas,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib.

Usage
1. Load the Dataset
The dataset is created and saved as a CSV file named your_dataset.csv.
2. Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
3. Create and Train the Model
A linear regression model is created and trained using the training data.
4. Make Predictions
The model is used to make predictions on both the training and testing data.
5. Evaluate the Model
The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both the training and testing data.
6. Visualize the Results
The actual vs predicted house prices are plotted for both the training and testing data.
